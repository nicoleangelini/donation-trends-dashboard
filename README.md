# Donation Trends Dashboard (2013–2022)
**Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation | May 2023 – Jul 2023**  
Built in Tableau | Data cleaned and structured in Excel/CSV format

## 📊 Project Overview
This project visualizes a decade of donation data (2013–2022) across three primary donation types—**Checks**, **ACH**, and **Credit Card**—to help the nonprofit understand how donor behavior has evolved. The dashboard allows internal teams to explore historical donation trends by type, source, and campaign category.

The interactive Tableau dashboard was designed for **executive leadership, fundraising, and events teams** to:
- Compare donation counts and totals by method (online vs. offline)
- Identify which **Funds, Programs, Appeals, and Packages** bring in the most revenue
- Track growth and decline of events, campaigns, and donation methods over time

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Queried and exported 10 large CSV files from **NetSuite**, each containing tens of thousands of rows
- Cleaned and organized data to standardize formats and remove duplicates
- Mapped records to four key item types:
  - **Contributions**
  - **Lemonade Stands & Events**
  - **Licensing & Royalties**
  - **Special Events**
- Further categorized each item by Fund, Program, Appeal, and Package hierarchy

## 📈 Key Dashboard Features
- **Donation Breakdown by Type and Channel** (Checks vs. ACH/Credit Card)
- **Top Performing Programs** by dollar amount and donation count
- **Year-over-Year Trends** from 2013–2022
- Filtering by time, donation method, item type, and campaign
- Interactive visuals enabling drill-down for deeper insight

## 🔍 Value to Stakeholders
- Enables informed strategic planning across departments
- Identifies underperforming programs for reevaluation
